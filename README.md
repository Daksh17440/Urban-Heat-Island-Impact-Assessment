The sole purpose of this research project is to find the future projection of temperatures in Mysore, Karnataka, India using Land Surface Temperature(LSTs) and Land Use and Land Cover(LULCs). 
LULC is made for years 2001, 2010, and 2022.
LST is made with daily mean temperatures recorded for 2001, 2010, and 2022.
LST is also made with monthly mean temperatures recorded from 2001 to 2020.
A seperate map is provided for temporal analysis of terrain on 2001, 2010, and 2022.
