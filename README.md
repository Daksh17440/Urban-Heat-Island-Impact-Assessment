The sole purpose of this research project is to find the future projection of temperatures in Mysore, Karnataka, India using Land Surface Temperature(LSTs) and Land Use and Land Cover(LULCs). 
LULC is made for years 2001, 2010,and 2022 for which I collected images from Landsat 7(LANDSAT/LE07/C02/T1_L2), Landsat 5 (LANDSAT/LT05/C02/T1_L2), and Landsat 8(LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2) respectively with less than 5% cloud cover.
LST is made with daily mean temperatures recorded for 2001, 2010,and 2022, monthly mean temperatures recorded from 2001 to 2022.
LST is also made on Tertile basis for Sumer, Winter and Monsoon months using the Modis satellite (MODIS/061/MOD11A1)
A seperate map is provided for temperature analysis of terrain on 2001, 2010,and 2022.
The projections of future LST and LULCs are made using regression in iterations.
